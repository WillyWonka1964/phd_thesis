I would like to acknowledge the support of my supervisors Prof. Dan Cutler, Dr Janos Kriston-Vizi, and Dr Hwee-Kuan Lee. Their guidance and critique through the duration of this research work has been invaluable. Grateful thanks to members of the Cutler Lab at the Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology in London: Jess McCormack, Kim Harrison-Lavoie, David Westmoreland, Francesco Ferraro, Mafalda Silva, and Francesca Patella. Without their consistent provision of high quality experimental data and microscopy images this work would not have been possible. Thank you also to members of the Computer Vision and Pattern Discovery group at the Bioinformatics Institute in Singapore: Patrick Koh, Chao Hui Huang, Emarene Kalaw, Yuan Ing Chow, Michael Loh, Malay Singh, and Konnie Koh. Their help with computer programming, image processing, and statistical data analysis has been invaluable.
